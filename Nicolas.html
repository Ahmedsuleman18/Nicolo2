  <h1>Is it better to loved or feared</h1>
  <p>
    Is it better to be loved or feared? Niccolò Macovei asked this question to determine whether a prince should
    be loved or feared. He answered it is better to be <br>both however if you can’t be both its better be feared.
    Machiavelli answered that although its theoretically possible to be both loved and feared. But should also always
    be feared in a sense to keep people check to prevent them from breaking laws.

  <h2>Religion</h2>

<p>Machiavelli’s most impressive inclination was his rejection of Christion virtue for its guide to leaders. This is since Niccolò’s Christian comrades believed a leader should be generous, tolerant, merciful, and peaceful. Suggesting a good leader or politician is the same as a good Christian. However, Niccolò debated that a good politician doesn’t necessarily have to follow Christian ethics he used Girolamo Savonarola as a case to win his argument. Girolamo was a keen, principled Christian whose life purpose was to build “the city of god on earth” in Florence. He spoke against excess and the tranny of the Medici and even led Florence to a peaceful democratic state. But this would not last - in Machiavelli’s base of view he believed it was a weakness to be good in the Christian sense. Not long after his regime began that it became a threat to the corrupt pope Alexander who ordered his henchmen to scheme, capture, torture, hang and burn him at the centre of Florence. This was a matter of time in Machiavelli’s eyes especially to someone who he saw as weak in politics. This is because he believed there will come a time where they can’t respond with generosity or kindness. This is especially true when enemies are not playing by the same rules. The dishonest will have an advantage. Machiavelli believed it was impossible to win decently but you must win to keep society safe.

<h2>A Criminal Virtue</h2>

<p>He then implicated that this specific “good Christian leader” is an example of which not to follow. Machiavelli dedicates that a leader should instead follow the judicious route, of which he called a “criminal virtue”. He also provided a criterion for what makes the occasion for criminal virtue: it needs to be for the safety of the state, it must be done quickly and quietly most commonly at night, and it must not be repeated, in case for a rise of mindless brutality. Machiavelli used Cesare Borgia as an example, whom he respected as a formidable leader, nonetheless, he still considered him an enemy. When Cesare conquered Cesena. He ordered one of his henchmen with the name of Remirro de Orco, to create order, Remirro did so in a brutal and instant way. Men were beheaded Infront of their children and wives, property was taken, traitors were neutered. Cesare then betrayed de Orco and had him killed in the public square to remind the townspeople who was in charge. Machiavelli admiringly admitted, that was enough killing. Cesare then cut taxes, imported cheap grain, and built infrastructure and planned some festivals so people will forget the killing and bloodshed.</p>

<h2>THE CHURCH</h2>

<p>The Catholic Church banned Machiavelli’s works for 200 years because of the force with which he had argued that being a good Christian was incompatible with being a good leader. But even for atheists and those of us who are not politicians, Machiavelli’s insights are important. He writes that we cannot be good at or for all things. We must pick which fields we want to excel in, and let the others pass—not only because of our limited abilities and resources, but also because of the conflicts within moral codes. Some of the fields we choose—if not being a prince, then perhaps business or family life or other forms of loyalty and responsibility—may require what we evasively call “difficult decisions”, by which we really mean ethical trade-offs. We may have to sacrifice our ideal visions of kindness for the sake of practical effectiveness. We may have to lie in order to keep a relationship afloat. We may have to ignore the feelings of the workforce in order to keep a business going.. That – insists Machiavelli – is the price of dealing with the world as it is, and not as we feel it should be. The world has continued to love and hate Machiavelli in equal measure for insisting on this uncomfortable truth.

<br>
<br>
Machiavelli is prey to a natural misunderstanding. It can sound as if he is on the side of thuggish or slightly brutal people; that he’s cheering on those who are mean or callous. But actually his stern advice – about being ruthless – is best directed to those who run the risk of losing what they really care about because at key moments they are not ruthless enough.</p>
